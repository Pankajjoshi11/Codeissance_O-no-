    case "Understanding Income":
      return `
        Income is the money you receive from various sources, such as your job, investments, or side businesses. 
        Knowing how much you earn, including gross and net income, helps you plan a budget that reflects your financial capacity. 
        It is essential to distinguish between active income (money you work for) and passive income (money you earn without ongoing effort, like investments).
      `;

    case "Expense Tracking":
      return `
        Tracking expenses involves recording everything you spend money on, from fixed expenses like rent and utilities to variable ones like entertainment and groceries. 
        This helps you understand where your money is going and allows you to identify areas where you can cut back if necessary. 
        Use tools like apps or spreadsheets to keep track of your daily, weekly, or monthly expenses.
      `;

    case "Savings Strategies":
      return `
        Saving money is key to financial health and preparing for future needs or emergencies. 
        Some common savings strategies include paying yourself first (setting aside savings before spending on anything else), 
        using automatic transfers to a savings account, and setting specific goals like saving for retirement, vacations, or large purchases.
      `;

    case "Debt Management":
      return `
        Managing debt effectively means having a strategy to pay off any loans or credit card debt while minimizing interest payments. 
        Popular methods include the debt snowball (paying off the smallest debts first to build momentum) and the debt avalanche (paying off high-interest debt first). 
        Itâ€™s also important to avoid taking on unnecessary new debt and make payments on time to protect your credit score.
      `;

    case "Creating a Budget Plan":
      return `
        A budget plan is a tool that helps you allocate your income to different spending categories such as rent, groceries, entertainment, and savings. 
        Start by listing your total income and then assign amounts to essential expenses, discretionary spending, and savings. 
        Stick to the 50/30/20 rule: 50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings or debt repayment.
      `;

    case "Emergency Funds":
      return `
        An emergency fund is money set aside to cover unexpected expenses, such as medical bills, car repairs, or sudden job loss. 
        Experts recommend having 3 to 6 months of living expenses saved in an easily accessible account. 
        The goal is to avoid going into debt when faced with an emergency.
      `;

    case "Investment Basics":
      return `
        Investing is putting your money into assets such as stocks, bonds, or real estate with the expectation of earning a return over time. 
        The goal of investing is to grow your wealth and help achieve long-term financial goals like retirement. 
        Itâ€™s important to understand the risks involved and diversify your investments to manage risk.
      `;

    case "Retirement Planning":
      return `
        Retirement planning involves setting financial goals for your life after work and figuring out how much you need to save and invest to achieve those goals. 
        Contributing to retirement accounts like a 401(k) or IRA helps you take advantage of compound interest and tax benefits. 
        The sooner you start, the more time your money has to grow, ensuring a comfortable retirement.
